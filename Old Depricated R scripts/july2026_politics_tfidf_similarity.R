# July 2026 r/politics sample — TF-IDF cosine similarity, comment to submission
#
# Standalone side analysis. Reads the raw Parquet comment and submission files,
# verifies the comment-to-submission link, represents every eligible comment and
# its submission as TF-IDF vectors over whitespace-delimited tokens, and measures
# the cosine similarity between each comment and its own submission under two
# submission representations (title; title + selftext). Source Parquet is
# read-only. All outputs are written under r_analysis_outputs/tfidf_similarity/
# and are reproducible by re-running this script top to bottom.

# ---- Setup: packages, paths, output directories ----
# INPUT : none.
# DOES  : load packages; define source paths; create output folders.
# OUTPUT: path variables; figures/ and tables/ directories.
